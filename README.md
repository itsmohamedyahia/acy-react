# Introducing `Acy`

`Acy` is an innovative educational platform designed to transform learning in Egyptian universities. Upon signing up, choose your major and univerisity and engage in three distinct modes of study: `Synapse`, `Mastery`, and `Blitz`, catering to diverse learning preferences and needs.

**Synapse** provides killer explanations for your curriculum topics. Think of it as *future you* teaching *current you*. We start from the basics and build up the logic. We provoke thoughts, ask questions, and keep you hungry for more. Then we reward you with beautiful explanations, diagrams, figures and videos and we make you contemplate if only we were around before for your previous studies.

**Mastery** provides multiple choice questions on every topic and subtopic. No more studying the whole subject just to be able to practice.

**Blitz** a fast inverted learning mode based on past paper exam questions. You start with reading the question and work back the knowledge chain. We explain the answer with any necessary information including terminology for comprehension. This mode has stood the test of time and space. Crafted with the help of expert crammers, we guarantee a 75% coverage of your exam questions through this mode alone. JUST FOR YOU, LAST-MINUTE CRAMMERS.
